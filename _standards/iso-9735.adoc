== ISO 9735 EDIFACT Application level syntax rules

In 1987, following the convergence of the UN and US/ANSI syntax proposals, the UN/EDIFACT Syntax Rules were approved as the ISO standard ISO 9735 by the International Organization for Standardization. It comprise a set of internationally agreed standards, directoÂ­ries, and guidelines for the electronic interchange of structured data, between independent computerized information systems.

The EDIFACT standard provides:

* set of syntax rules to structure data
* an interactive exchange protocol (I-EDI)
* standard messages which allow multi-country and multi-industry exchange

=== Who needs this standard?

Communities with wide EDIFACT adoption, e.g. retail, maritime, customs.
