== Purpose

Calendars are an essential element in date tracking.

With multiple calendar systems in common use across
the international community, it is necessary for a number
of applications to identify calendar systems used
for particular dates and times, including for
computing, archiving, communication and bibliography.

This standard sets out the necessary procedures to maintain
the registry of calendar systems.

== Scope

This document provides a list of codes to represent
calendar systems and the corresponding maintenance
procedures.

The codes were devised for usage of any application requiring
the expression of calendar systems in coded form, including
for data interchange.
