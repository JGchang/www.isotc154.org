Michael Dill studied Economics and had his first contact with the eBusiness
world in 1987, when he read an article about the approval of the EDIFACT
Syntax by ISO TC 154.

In 1990, he started an independent Berlin-based EDI software and consultancy
company called GEFEG mbH to develop an EDI implementation tool. Today, the
latest versions of the GEFEG tool provide a rich metadata environment for UML
or Core Component data modelling, guideline development, customisations, HTML
publication, validation plus mapping to EDIFACT, US ANSI X.12 CICA and XML
schema implementation. Michael has wide experience as an EDI consultant and
has worked on implementation projects in the railway sector, the white goods,
automotive, electronics, retail and dental industries, eGov and for Customs
developments.

As a consultant for the G7 Customs Group he developed the first global G7
Data Models which have been developed on to become the WCO Data Model. His
special interest is how to open smooth migration paths from legacy paper,
EDI(FACT) and XML standards to the upcoming world of interoperable eStandard
and services.

He has contributed for many years to the development of international
standards related to cross-border trade where he currently plays an active
role in the development of WCO Data Model and from 2005 to 2017 he has been
the Head of the German Delegation to ISO TC 154.

Michael has extensive experience in the implementation of data modelling by
Customs, UNCEFACT, OASIS UBL, Automotive, eGovernment, Aerospace and Defence,
Global Transport, GS1 (EAN.UCC), WCO, SAP, OAGi, SWIFT etc.
