=== Liaison Updates

* Nothing to report


=== MoU/MG Update

* K-DN reported that talking with Brian Stanton (ISO/CS) a solution was found to move forward with circulating both ISO 8601 parts after the ballots close. Assuming both are approved, ISO C/S will work with MoU/MG members to ensure that those that use ISO 8601 do get involved in the work.


=== Old Business

* CAT's comments on UNECEs Proposed Strategic Framework 2016

* No response was received


* CAT's response to UN/CEFACT Bureau email regarding UNECE Recommendation 1

* No response was received


* ISO Letter to IMO (WCO Data Model)

* K-DN and FV to draft a response to TC 8, for SP to review.




=== New Business

* UNECE's comments about misleading CAT minutes 2015--12--09

* K-DN talked with Brain Stanton (ISO/CS) about the UNECE concern. It was agreed that the TC 154 minutes did reflect what was said. If UNECE or UN/CEFACT disagree that the position communicated during that MoU/MG call were not what should have been said, UNECE and/or UN/CEFACT need to inform the MoU/MG with the correct position as related to the publication of UBL 2.1 as ISO/IEC 19845. It is not up to TC 154 to change its minutes because of a disagreement within the UNECE and/or UN/CEFACT.


* MoU/MG Resolution 15/06: Forming a liaison with ISO/TC 292 for its parts of 28000 series

* K-DN to asked WG 6/PT 1 (Peter and Masashi) for feedback and the need for a liaison.
