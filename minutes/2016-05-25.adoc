<ul>
<li>ISO/CS provided TC with a procedure in response to the MoU/MG request to distribute the ISO 8601 NWIP and CD.</li>
<li>CAT agreed to provide the ISO/CS with its final response:<br />
<blockquote>_Since the resolution is directed towards ISO/CS it is your [ISO/CS’s] responsibility to provide a response to the MoU/MG how to fulfill their request._

_ISO/TC 154 has reported twice to the MoU/MG outlining the changes to the revised ISO 8601 which triggered the MoU/MG request to have both drafts distributed to its membership. It was Henry’s objection, stating that current rules don’t allow this, which resulted in the above mention resolution._

_It is CAT’s view that the proposed procedure does not address the main request of the MoU/MG to allow the circulation of the drafts. However, since the MoU/MG resolution asks the ISO/CS for a mechanics, not ISO/TC 154, we will standby until the MoU/MG and ISO/CS have agreed to a solution agreeable to both sides satisfaction._
