=== Electronic data interchange for administration, commerce and transport (EDIFACT) -- Rules for generation of XML scheme files (XSD) on the basis of EDI(FACT) implementation guidelines
==== Abstract
ISO/TS 20625:2002 describes the rules for the derivation of XML schemas from EDI MIGs providing a sound method of representing semantic facts.

ISO/TS 20625:2002 describes how to derive XML from UN/EDIFACT MIGs. In principle, the rules are equally applicable to other EDI standards.

It does not apply to DTDs.
