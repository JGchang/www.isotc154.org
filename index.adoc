      <p>
        It is the vision of ISO/TC 154 that all parties in the value chain
        use standardized data exchange to reduce cost in managing the processes
        in the private and public domain and to foster trade facilitation.

      <p>
        The mission of ISO/TC 154 is both to undertake and to facilitate
        the development and maintenance of international standards for data exchange
        in the value chain.

      <p>
        These standards cover data exchange regardless of the media used.
