* CAT reviewed and agreed to Plenary Draft Agenda.

=== ISO/DTR 18262 ODIF (stage 50.00)

* CA agreed to revise the current DTR to serve as a internal framework for ISO/TC 154.
* K-DN agreed to create the first revision to be available for the upcoming plenary.




== New Business

== ISO/CS Objection to disseminate Drafts of both ISO/CD 8601 parts to MoU/MG

* ISO/CS provided TC with a procedure in response to the MoU/MG request to distribute the ISO 8601 NWIP and CD.

* CAT agreed to question the procedure since it does not address the request for CD distribution. Further, the proposed process by the ISO/CS for the internal review of the NWIP request seems unnecessary as it is against the fundamental principle of the MoU to collaborate to eliminate duplications, overlap and conflicts amongst standards.

* K-DN, BB & FV to draft response to ISO/CS.




== Other Business
