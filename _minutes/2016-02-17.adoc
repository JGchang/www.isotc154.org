=== WG 5 (Representation of dates and times)

* K-DN: Reported that WG 5 has completed both WDs and NWIP (Form 4) and recommends that CAT approve that both parts go out for NWIP and CD ballots.

* CAT agreed to ballot both ISO 8601 Parts at the same time as NWIP and CD.

* Regarding the objection by Henry Cuschieri (ISO/CS) during the last MoU/MG meeting for ISO/TC 154's to circulate both NWIP and CD Ballots for feedback about the many extensions and proposed solution regarding the midnight issue, *nothing has been forthcoming from Henry*, who agreed to look into this, regarding a possible way forward.

* Since CAT was unable to identify any rules forbidding the sharing with the MoU/MG, CAT agreed that K-DN, SP, BB and FV draft a message to Henry and Brian Stanton, copy to Howard Mason, asking to get a copy of the rules in question that forbid ISO/TC 154 to circulate the NWIP and CDs for ISO 8601 Parts 1 & 2.
