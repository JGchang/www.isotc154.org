=== ISO/TC 154 Chairmanship (2017- )

* Current term is ending at end of 2016. A second term of 3 years is possible for K-DN. No other candidate was being identified. For K-DN to stand for another term he requires some sponsorship for attending future TC 154 plenaries.


=== Business Semantic Thesaurus ISO/TS 16668, formally BSR

* K-DN raided the topic of updating the original "`ISO/TS 16668 Basic Semantic Repository`" that was withdrawn because of ISO/TS 15000-5. However, as learned from the PoC on Semantic Interoperability, ISO 15000-5 is about data and message components, not the semantic meaning of Business concepts. During the PoC much of the original BSR was reused, which should now be applied for the rewrite.

== Other Business
