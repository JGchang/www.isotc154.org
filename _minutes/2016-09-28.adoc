=== ISO/NP TS (old: 21887)/21981 Business Semantics Thesaurus (BST)

* _Due to an system error a duplicate ISO number (21887) was assigned, the new number is now "`21981`"_.

* Ballot Results

** _Project approved with no negative vote and enough expert nominations_
** _UK comments are about changes to the NWIP. Since it was approved without a negative vote, nor did UK provide a rational for any of their changes, no further action will be taken._
** _The result of the ballot was 50% approved as the stage 20.00, and 50% approved as the WG stage 20.20. However, since most of the 20.00 votes came from those who decided "`not`" to participate, their choice has be negated, since no comments were provided why they did not support the attached WD. Therefore, since those who agreed to participate in the work supported a 20.20 status (3 approved out of 5), CAT agreed to register the project with a 20.20 status._
