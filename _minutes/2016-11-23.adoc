=== WG 7 (Digital Business)

* Regarding the suggested name change from "`eBusiness`" to "`Business`", it was agreed the definition of business is to broad as it is defined as "`the activity of making, buying, or selling goods or providing services in exchange for money`". Clearly not what the WG is about. Originally as per NWIP it was to be called "`eBusiness`", but BSI objected because of SC32/WG 1 already using it. After a discussion it was agree to call it "`Digital Business`" which is better than just "`Business`" and it does fit the projects that have been assigned to it.

* JF to setup WG 7 on LiveLink.
