== ISO 15000-5 (Core Component Specification)

=== Is UBL 2.1 in conformance with ISO/TS 15000-5:2005?

The questions was raised because of a statement on the UBL Home page, which states:

[quote]
____
UBL was the first published data format specification produced in full conformance with UN/CEFACT's ebXML Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) Version 2.01 -- ISO TS/15000–5:2005.
____

*For a standard to claim full conformance it must satisfy 100% of all the mandatory 'requirements' found in the 'normative' sections.*

ISO/TS 15000–5:2005 (and UN/CEFACT's ebXML Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) Version 2.01) both contain the same statements defining conformance as:

* Applications will be considered to be in full conformance with this technical specification if they comply with the content of normative sections, rules and definitions.
* Section 4.2 defines sections 6,7,8 and 9 as being normative.

The short answer is that *UBL 2.1 is not in conformance* with either version since it *_breaks at least one mandatory rule!_*

For the long answer, see the table below that list examples of *requirements that are not met* by UBL 2.1 to be in conformance:

[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
|ISO TS/15000–5:2005 Normative Rules
|OASIS UBL 2.1 Library Entries

|[B3] A Basic Business Information Entity *shall be based* on a Basic Core Component
|Does *not* include any Basic Core Components


|[B4] An Association Business Information Entity *shall be based* on an Association Core Components
|Does *not* include any Association Core Components


|[B5] An Aggregate Business Information Entity *shall be based* on an Aggregate Core Component
|Does *not* include any Aggregate Core Components.


|[B7] A Business Information Entity Property of an Aggregate Business Information Entity *shall be based* on a Core Component Property of the corresponding Aggregate Core Component
|Does *not* include any Aggregate Business Information Entities


|[B8] The Data Type, on which a Basic Business Information Entity Property *is based, shall itself be similar</strong> to the Data Type on which the corresponding Basic Core Component Property *is based* (i.e. it *shall either* be the same Data Type or a more restricted one)
|Does *not* include any Basic Core Component Properties


|[B9] The Aggregate Business Information Entity, on which an Association Business Information Entity Property *is based, shall itself be based* on the Aggregate Core Component on which the corresponding Association Core Component Property is based
|Does *not* include any Aggregate Core Components or Association Core Components


|[C1] Each Core Component Type, Basic Core Component, Association Core Component or Aggregate Core Component *must have its own unique semantic definition within the library of which it is a part*. The definition shall be developed first and the Dictionary Entry Name shall be extracted from it. Comments can be used to further clarify the definition, to provide examples and/or to reference a recognized standard
|There are *no publicly published* core components that allow this rule to be followed


|[C18] The Dictionary Entry Name shall be concise and *shall not contain consecutive redundant words*
|Examples of entries not in conformance:

Address. Address Type _Code_. _Code_

Order Reference. Sales Order _Identifier_. _Identifier_

Tax Category. Per Unit _Amount_. _Amount_

=== What are the differences between ISO 15000-5 and OASIS' UBL?


The table below shows on the left side the required parts defined within ISO 15000–5:2014. The right side shows the corresponding parts, if available, within OASIS' UBL 2.0 and 2.1.

|ISO 15000–5:2014
|OASIS UBL 2.0 and 2.1

|Syntax Neutral data model
|XML only (syntax specific)

Data model non-normative (optional)

Implementations are considered to be *in full conformance* with ISO 15000–5:2014 if they *comply with the content of normative clauses, rules and definitions*. footnote:[ISO 15000–5:2014, Section 6]
